                        is unable to maintain himself from his own earning or out of the property owned by him,is
                        entitled to get relief under this Act.</p>

                        sleep, but for safety and community.We are much more than a home for children from difficult and
                        desperate circumstances.We are a family, where love guides us all as we grow and expand year
                        after year. </p>

                    <p class="center">The day each family keeps aside food to feed one hungry person or animal or a bird
                        everyday,nobody will go hungry in this world.Donating food sometimes to the poor satisfies our
                        hunger rather than of the poor.
